                        Power disruptions, mechanical malfunctions, or improper handling of elevator controls can
                        all potentially bring an elevator to a standstill. Should you or someone else ever find

                    {/* Step 1 */}
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
                        1. Stay Calm and Wait for Authorization Before Exiting
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The foremost rule is to maintain composure. Never try to exit the car without receiving
                        explicit clearance from certified professionals or emergency responders. While it might feel
                        unsettling to be confined in a stopped elevator, panicking can lead to rash decisions.
                        Trained technicians or the Fire Department have the right knowledge and equipment to
                        determine when it is actually safe to leave the car.
                    </p>

                    {/* Step 2 */}
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
                    2. Use the Built-In Emergency Features to Call for Help
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Modern elevators are equipped with emergency systems to request assistance. Look for an
                        alarm button, intercom, or phone panel. By pressing the alarm or speaking into the intercom,
                        you can communicate with on-site security, building management, or professional responders
                        who will dispatch help promptly.
                    </p>

                    {/* Step 3 */}
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
                        3. Steer Clear of the Doors
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        No matter how tempted you might be, do not force the doors open. Even if it looks like the
                        doors could be opened by hand, this action can be hazardous, especially if the car is not
                        aligned with a proper exit level. Instead, maintain a safe distance from the doors until a
                        trained individual advises you otherwise.
                    </p>

                    {/* Step 4 */}
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
                        4. Remember There Is Adequate Ventilation
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Contrary to common fears, elevator cars are designed with ventilation in mind. Air can flow
                        into the cab, preventing any risk of running out of oxygen. Reassure yourself or any other
                        passengers that there is plenty of air circulating in the space, which helps keep everyone
                        calm while waiting for professional assistance.
                    </p>

                    {/* Step 5 */}

                        5. Rely on Qualified Help for Rescue
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        If the situation truly warrants evacuation, that process must be carried out exclusively by
                        someone with the necessary expertise—an elevator specialist or the Fire Department.
                        Attempting a rescue without the right skills and equipment puts everyone at risk. It is
                        always better to wait for personnel trained to handle such a circumstance.
                    </p>

                    {/* If You’re Outside the Elevator */}

                        If You’re Outside the Elevator, Never Attempt a DIY Rescue
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When you notice an elevator has unexpectedly stopped and passengers seem to be trapped,
                        resist the urge to intervene on your own. Though well-intended, such attempts can easily
                        result in injuries or property damage. Instead, inform those inside that help is on the way
                        and advise them to avoid forcing the doors open or pushing any switches unnecessarily.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Encourage anyone inside to stay calm and remind them that the elevator is secure, provided
                        they follow safety guidelines. Emphasize that there’s ample air circulation.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Maintain a Line of Communication</h3>
                    <p>
                        If possible, use the elevator’s built-in communication system or simply speak through the
                        closed doors. Let the trapped individuals know that someone has already alerted a technician
                        or building security.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Request Simple Troubleshooting</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ask the individual to press the “door open” button, just in case the car is actually level
                        with a floor and the doors can be opened normally.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Check the Emergency Stop Switch</h3>
                    <p>
                        Verify that the red “emergency stop” control inside the cab is set to “Run,” if it’s
                        accessible. Sometimes an accidental bump to this switch can halt the elevator.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Contact Your Elevator Service Provider</h3>
                    <p>
                        Notify your elevator maintenance company immediately that people are stuck inside. Provide
                        accurate details, such as your building address, elevator number (if applicable), and a
                        contact phone number in case the technician needs more information.
                    </p>

                        Avoid Calling 911 Unless It’s a Genuine Crisis
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Emergency responders should only be brought in if there’s a critical health or life-threatening
                        circumstance. In certain cases, untrained individuals can inadvertently damage elevator
                        systems while trying to free passengers, making the situation even more dangerous or costly.
                        Building managers, facilities personnel, or professional elevator technicians are almost
                        always the best first line of assistance.
                    </p>

                    {/* Safety & Standards */}

                        Safety Measures and Industry Standards
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Regulations like ASME/ANSI A17.1 and CAN/CSA-B44 require that hoistway doors include a
                        specialized “emergency unlocking device,” which can only be operated with a dedicated key.
                        This device allows trained professionals to open the doors from outside when necessary.
                        Because these procedures demand technical expertise, building staff should refrain from using
                        these keys themselves unless properly instructed and authorized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elevator companies build multiple safety mechanisms into their products to minimize hazards.
                        Though sudden shutdowns are inconvenient, they typically don’t pose a direct threat to
                        occupants. Nonetheless, building staff can play a significant part by offering reassurance,
                        coordinating with the appropriate service provider, and ensuring that no unauthorized rescue
                        attempts take place.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Even though an elevator can pause operation for various reasons, the built-in protective
                        features help ensure that passengers are rarely in real danger. By following the appropriate
                        steps—keeping calm, communicating with trapped riders, and relying on professional rescue
                        efforts—you’ll help maintain a safe environment for everyone. Properly functioning elevators
                        are a modern convenience that we all benefit from, and adhering to these guidelines fosters a
                        swift and secure resolution whenever something does go wrong.
